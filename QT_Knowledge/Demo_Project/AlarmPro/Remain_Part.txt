1. Fix Bug: when turn off alarm -> don't set remain time for the next repeating day

2. Handle multi timer follow the list alarm
Guideline to handle multi timer:
Step 1: loop each element in array infoToAlarm
Step 2: change variable remainingTime => array to contain remaining time of each alarm
Step 3: create list of timer object in qml to contain for each alarm
Step 4: handle logic

3. Handle alarm notification in the following cases:
- Launch app: load in AlarmModel done
- Create new alarm in AlarmDialog done
- Delete a alarm
- When saving a modified alarm
- When turn off a alarm notification
- When switching  => re-run function: handleAlarm(): in AlarmDelegate 136 done
